We should think about establishing workgroups today. This should probably be fluid, but perhaps we want to brain storm in google docs. Some ideas:
* Process groups:
   * Stemming / stop-word removal 
   * Word frequency
   * Topic analysis
   * Sentiment / Tone
   * …
* Topic groups:
   * Film
   * books
   * news
   * social

## Sharing Python code
For data collection and grooming we might want to share snippets of python.  How should we do this?  Github / gists? pasting into slack?

## Feedback on mockups.
