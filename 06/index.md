## Standup / Status reports
1 minute or less. Where are you, what are your working on?  Next stewp to be ready for propsal? Identify major concerns. (brief w/o feedback).

### Google docs (spreadsheet) checklist:

* Data-processing software?
* Venue for publication? (online / poster / article)

### Workgroups?

* Process groups:
   * Stemming / stop-word removal 
   * Word frequency
   * Topic analysis
   * Sentiment / Tone
   * …
* Topic groups:
   * Film
   * books
   * news
   * social

## Sharing Python code
For data collection and grooming we might want to share snippets of python.  How should we do this?  Github / gists? pasting into slack?

## Feedback on mockups.
