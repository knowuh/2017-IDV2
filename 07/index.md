# Class 07 â€“ 2017-02-21

## Class 7 of 14

## Proposal posters due next week.
You are all in a good place to start working on these posters. You have interesting topics. We have identified the challenges and found them surmountable. For next week you will be producing posters (PDF or site mock-up). Your poster should aspirational and compelling. It should:
  * Tell us what data you are looking at.
  * Convince us the data is worth investigating.
  * Give us an idea of what it might eventually look like.
  
## Quick inspiration:
  * [Peter Cho](http://www.typotopo.com/projects.php?id=warofworlds)  
  * [This is not Peters](https://vimeo.com/7292703)
  * [Every NYT cover ever](https://vimeo.com/204951759)

Many of you are going to be worried about *how* you will execute your idea. Don't worry about that this week. We will spend the next 6 weeks working on implementation. What tools do people use for producing posters and mockups? 
  * Photoshop
  * Illustrator
  * Sketch
  * [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent)
  * [InvisionApp](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects)
  

## Presentations from people who want feedback. (K & A?)
Some people did not have a chance to present last week.  They should do so. Other folks looking for feedback can also ask for it at this time.
